# PR #2 Plan: Baseline Metrics and Validation

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation details for the second PR in our refactoring effort, focusing on establishing baseline metrics to ensure we maintain existing functionality during refactoring.

## Objective

Create a reliable set of baseline metrics and validation tests that:

1. Capture the current behavior and performance of the system
2. Can be used to validate that refactoring doesn't break existing functionality
3. Provide a clear signal when changes impact system behavior

## Components to Implement

### 1. Metrics Module

Implement a comprehensive metrics module that can:

- Calculate retrieval metrics (Recall@k, MRR, etc.)
- Track performance metrics (latency, memory usage)
- Compare metrics against baselines
- Generate reports on metric changes

### 2. Baseline Generation

Create tools to generate baseline metrics from the current system:

- Script to run the system with test data
- Storage of baseline metrics in a standardized format
- Documentation of how baselines were generated
- Versioning of baselines

### 3. Validation Tests

Implement tests that can validate that refactoring doesn't break existing functionality:

- Comparison of refactored system against baseline metrics
- Automated testing that fails when metrics degrade beyond thresholds
- Clear reporting of differences

### 4. Test Data

Prepare test data that can be used for validation:

- Representative sample datasets
- Edge cases and challenging examples
- Consistent test environment configuration

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will proceed in the following order:

1. Define the metrics format and calculation methods
2. Implement baseline generation
3. Create validation tests
4. Prepare test data
5. Document the baseline metrics and validation process

## Testing Strategy

The PR will include:

1. Unit tests for the metrics calculation code
2. Integration tests for baseline generation
3. Tests that demonstrate validation against baselines
4. Reliability tests to ensure metrics are stable

## Completion Criteria

The PR will be considered complete when:

1. We have a reliable set of baseline metrics
2. We can validate that changes don't break existing functionality
3. The metrics and validation tests are well-documented
4. The process is automated and can be run as part of CI

At this point, the PR will represent a complete conceptual unit that provides the necessary safeguards for future refactoring work.
