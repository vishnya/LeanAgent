# LeanAgent Refactoring Plan

This document outlines our approach to refactoring the LeanAgent codebase through conceptual phases, each focused on a specific functional goal.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (PR #1)

Establish core package infrastructure to support systematic refactoring:
- Proper package structure with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration management system
- Testing framework and baseline metrics
- Project infrastructure (pyproject.toml, etc.)

### Phase 2: Baseline Metrics

Create mechanisms to ensure refactoring doesn't break existing functionality:
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Automated validation testing
- CI integration

### Phase 3: Modular Components

Refactor codebase into modular components with clear responsibilities:
- Database module for data persistence
- Retrieval module for finding relevant examples
- Prover module for theorem proving
- Common utilities

### Phase 4: API Modernization

Define stable, well-documented APIs for each module:
- Type annotations
- Comprehensive documentation
- Examples and usage guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Each phase will be implemented through focused PRs that deliver complete conceptual units:
- **Conceptual Cohesion**: Each PR implements a complete functional component
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All code is thoroughly tested
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain compatibility with existing code
- **Clear Boundaries**: PRs have minimal dependencies on future changes

This approach prioritizes conceptual completeness over PR size, ensuring each change delivers tangible value.
