# Implementation Plan for PR #1: Package Infrastructure and Configuration Management

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation details for the first PR in our refactoring effort, focusing on establishing package infrastructure and configuration management as a complete conceptual unit.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Package Structure

Create a well-organized package structure:

```
leanagent/
├── __init__.py           # Version and package info
├── config.py             # Configuration management
├── cli.py                # Command-line interface
├── retrieval/            # Retrieval functionality
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── metrics.py        # Metrics for evaluation
├── db/                   # Database operations
│   └── __init__.py
├── prover/               # Prover functionality
│   └── __init__.py
└── utils/                # Common utilities
    └── __init__.py
```

### 2. Configuration System

Implement a flexible configuration system that can:

- Load configuration from YAML files
- Override settings with environment variables
- Override settings with command-line arguments
- Provide sensible defaults
- Validate configuration values

The configuration system will use a hierarchical approach with the following precedence (highest to lowest):
1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Default values

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure:

- `pytest.ini` configuration
- Test directory structure:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── conftest.py         # Shared fixtures
  ├── fixtures/           # Test data
  ├── integration/        # Integration tests
  └── unit/               # Unit tests
      ├── test_config.py
      ├── retrieval/
      ├── db/
      └── utils/
  ```
- Basic test utilities and fixtures
- Example tests for the configuration system

### 4. Package Management

Implement proper package management:

- `pyproject.toml` for Poetry
- Dependencies list
- Development dependencies
- Entry points for CLI

### 5. Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation:

- Update refactoring plan
- PR description
- README with usage instructions
- Configuration documentation
- Code docstrings

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will proceed in the following order:

1. Set up the basic package structure
2. Implement the configuration system
3. Create testing infrastructure
4. Set up package management
5. Add documentation

Each component will be fully implemented before moving to the next, ensuring that the PR delivers a complete, working system that can be used as the foundation for future refactoring efforts.

## Testing Strategy

The PR will include:

1. Unit tests for the configuration system
2. Tests demonstrating configuration loading from different sources
3. Basic integration tests showing the system working together

All tests will be run automatically before submission to ensure the system works as expected.

## Completion Criteria

The PR will be considered complete when:

1. The package structure is properly set up
2. The configuration system is fully implemented and tested
3. The testing infrastructure is in place
4. Package management is configured
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

At this point, the PR will represent a complete conceptual unit that provides the foundation for future refactoring work.
